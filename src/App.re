 * In OCaml, a module is similar to a TypeScript or JavaScript module.
 * It's a way to group related functions, types, and components. Here, `App`
 * is a module that encapsulates our main app component.
 *
 * The `[@react.component]` attribute is a special annotation in OCaml for
 * React. It's used to define a React component in a way that's more idiomatic
 * to OCaml. This attribute automatically manages the props transformation,
 * providing a seamless integration with React's component model.
 *
 * The `make` function inside the module is equivalent to defining a functional
 * component in React using JavaScript or TypeScript. In ReasonReact, it's
 * common to name the main function of a component `make` instead of the
 * component's name.
